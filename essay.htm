	<h2 style="color:white; ">Disconnection</h2>
	<p style="color:white; font-size: 1.2em;">
		Contemporary technologies have the power to disconnect an individual from society and relationships. The film <u>Lion</u> (2016) by Garth Davis is based on the disconnection of a relationship and Saroo’s journey to reunite this relationship. The truest of natural human relationships are disconnected by technology. For every new technology there is a new power to disconnect individuals from their relationships. The film <u>Lion</u> was made due to Saroo’s disconnection facilitated by technology. Saroo only has limited connection to distribute in his relationships and to society. Technologies likes trains or Google Maps extract Saroo’s connections to humans by disconnecting with the present and engaging with technology.

		Saroo had many relationships to maintain including with his Indian mother, Australian family and his girlfriend. The gear system within this photo represents human relationships. The gears on the front pedal represent the first person in the relationship and the gears on the rear wheel represent the other person. The potential rider of this bike is the relationship. The relationship has control of whether the gears are lowerer or higher with the outcome being the progress made on the bike journey. If the chain is disconnected from this bike system, then the gears go in their own directions and the bike as a whole goes nowhere. The tension between Saroo and his girlfriend in the film eventually get to overwhelming for Saroo therefore causing the chain to snap in their relationship which leads to disconnection and stagnation for Saroo. Saroo was more connected with the technology Google Maps which is not a true human relationship.

		This child Saroo encounters on his train journey is disconnected by technology. Initially the wide-angle long shot directs the viewer to focus on the child that is placed slightly below centre of the frame. This is done as the train is visually above the child suggesting the train’s technological superiority. This child has been placed in a brown and barren landscape alone to show complete disconnection. The train in the image is a physical barrier between the child and the more luscious green trees opposite. The train in this shot appears to be almost infinite horizontally with the wide-angle nature of this shot.  This child stares blankly at Saroo as he is just part of the train and has seen many trains before and will see many trains again. Saroo’s train is a vector that leads the viewers eyes from the left to the right of the screen which is also the direction the train travels also. For the child this is another train flashing before his eyes. The train consumes this child’s landscape, world and livelihood. The technology of the train has bought a physical and mental barrier to the child’s connection to society and human relationships.

		Saroo becomes deeply disconnected and only focused on his Google Maps mission to find his Indian family. Saroo tries his hardest to disconnect and isolate himself even when among society. The medium shot shows the closeness to Saroo whilst also displaying the shopping centre. The shot continues to be as compact as possible by deliberate blur and focus only on Saroo. Saroo is further displaying to be disconnected and adds to this scene being mainly focused in Saroo’s mind not the outside world. The costuming of Saroo further suggests that Saroo is wishing to be separated from others. Saroo has as much skin as possible covered to create a barrier between himself and society, the hoodie shows decreased peripheral vision meaning that Saroo has a target and a focus. Costuming is displaying the feelings and expressions of Saroo when his facial features and body language cannot. The facial features are not displayed in this shot as Saroo has his back turned on the viewer. His eyes do not face in or near the camera as this would display connection. Body posture also has an impact as he is crouching over slightly and shielding himself from society. His full body closing off is facilitating Saroo relive his flashbacks. Non-diegetic sounds and including the reoccurring journey music and noises from India play through Saroo’s head. When Saroo is disconnected physically from Google Maps he remains mentally with Google maps and he presents himself like he wants to stay connected with the technology Google maps.

		Google maps disconnects and consumes Saroo mentally and entirely. Saroo wants to find his way to his Indian home and he achieves this by disconnecting from his Australian home. Instead of connecting by relationships Saroo takes refuge in Google maps. In this shot Saroo is about to awaken to the real world. Whilst he is within sleep Saroo is grasping his laptop and holding it close to his heart. The technology has made its way to Saroo’s unconscious heart as it has been Saroo’s new replacement for human connection. This satisfaction with the connection with the laptop is shown on Saroo’s face which appears to be relaxed and in comfort whilst hugging the laptop. This comfort is very intimate and is shown with a close-up shot. Saroo only has his laptop for comfort now as he has reduced most of his relationships with family and his girlfriend to a bad state. The angle of the camera therefore looks down on Saroo and his desperate situation. Saroo has ended up with an unconscious dependence on technology and has disconnected heavily with society and his relationships.

	Contemporary technologies have the power to disconnect an individual from society and relationships. There are many relationships in this film that Saroo had to maintain including with his Indian mother, Australian family and his girlfriend.  All for these relationships were threatened by technology during the film. Garth Davis even used a homeless child Saroo encounters on his train journey to show disconnection brought by technology. The new technology that threatens disconnection during <u>Lion</u> evolves from trains into Google maps. These technologies consistently disconnect their user human relationships and society as the cost of using the technology. Therefore, contemporary technologies have the power to disconnect an individual from society and relationships.
